\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{detailed.data}, a component of the output of \code{\link{import.and.process.data}}..}

Violin plots (with box plots) showing the distribution of the total length of hospital stay for patients who were admitted to ICU/HDU and the
distribution of the lengths of stay within ICU/HDU. The coloured areas of the plot indicate the kernel probability density of the observed data
and the box plots show the median and interquartile range of the lengths of stay.
}
